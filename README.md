# HOPER Systems

Autonomous agents built for long-term execution. Anchored natively to the XOAT network.

## Overview

HOPER Systems is a platform for autonomous agents designed to pursue long-term goals with minimal human management.

Instead of short-lived prompt interactions, HOPER agents operate continuously through structured planning, execution loops, and persistent memory — with state anchored to XOAT.

---

## Core Philosophy

- Goal-driven, not prompt-driven  
- Persistent, not session-based  
- Autonomous, not manually supervised  
- Verifiable, not opaque  

HOPER agents are designed to operate independently over extended time horizons.

## How It Works

1. Define a long-term objective  
2. Initialize an autonomous agent  
3. Agent plans and executes tasks  
4. Memory updates continuously  
5. State is anchored to XOAT  
6. Loop continues until goal completion  

---

## Execution Loop

```pseudo
initialize(goal)

while not completed:
    evaluate_progress()
    generate_plan()
    execute_tasks()
    update_memory()
    anchor_state_to_xoat()
```
